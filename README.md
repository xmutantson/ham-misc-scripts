Verification Grid: Creates a 6x6 alphanumeric battleship grid to be used to verify that the radio operator is truly the person you think they are. Generate the grid, share via secure means ahead of time, then verify over insecure channel (such as ham radio).

Operator 1: "Operator 2, verify A3"
Operator 2: "A3, XR. D4?"
Operator 1: "D4, L0"

...and now these two know that they are actually talking to who they think they are talking to. Useful over digital modes where voices aren't present, but with AI these days you might not be able to even trust that.
